		I have been using Claude for the past couple of months and ChatGPT for a few months before that. Both
		are obviously very good tools but I'd rank Claude as better than ChatGPT. My first few weeks of using these tools felt like magic. It felt like
		they could respond to anything. The next couple of weeks I'd get frustrated with them, trying to test their limits. I'd become so lazy that
		I completely stopped using my brain. Even when I had enough to code up whatever I was doing myself, I'd become so accustomed to asking them for answers
		that I'd hurl abuses at them (lol) and tell them they were wrong in frustration. It took some time, but once you use these tools for a bit, you can
		gauge whether you're going to get an answer or not. After that point, there's no use in trying to get an answer from them (<i>and to use your brain instead</i>)
		because they are going to go around in circles and you are going to waste your time.
	</p>
	<p>
		I've found Claude extremely useful for CSS, Webpack, TSConfig related questions. For example, I was recently
		stuck on loading an `ESM` file of a library for a specific microfrontend in a Single Spa React Setup. If I placed it in the `index.ejs` section of `app-root`,
		it would get loaded for all the microfrontends. I wanted to load the `ESM` file only for the specific microfrontend that used it. And after a bit of
		prompting it gave me the answer.
		<pre className="mt-4 flex flex-col gap-2 w-[20rem] lg:w-full">
			<p>
				```js title="root-component.tsx"
				import('path/to/esm/file')
			    .then((library) => {
			        window['library'] = library;
			    })
			    .catch((error) => {
			        console.error('Error loading ESM file:', error);
			    });
			```
			</p>
			<p>
			```js title="webpack.config.js"
				...
				alias: {
	                library: path.resolve(__dirname, 'path/to/esm/file'),
	            },
				...
			```
			</p>
		</pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		There were several other `TSConfig` related questions where it saved me a lot of time in figuring out the correct option to use. I also found it
		extremely useful when I had to write a Jira Plugin for work (it was hard to find the relevant information for the specific version I was using online).
	</p>
	<p>
		But recently I've been doing a lot of `Reactive` programming in `Quarkus`, and it's been a disappointment. Maybe my own limited understanding during my
		initial days of reactive programming added to me not being able to articulate myself better to these chat tools. But it brought me to the conclusion that it's much better
		to stay away from Claude/ChatGPT and their ilk in the beginner stages of learning something. Only once you've gained some sort of fluency with the
		new tool you're learning and can't find anything in the documentation, it's better to resort to using Claude/ChatGPT.
	</p>
	<p>
		I don't pay for any of these tools, and having a limit on the number of questions that I can ask Claude has been a blessing in that I don't resort
		to using it for every small issue that I get stuck on. There were times when, in the amount of time I spent trying to correctly prompt ChatGPT into
		answering my question, I could've solved it myself.

		<p>
			Claude/ChatGPT and their ilk are extremely useful when used in moderation. But if you're learning a new tool/framework/language, it's best to
			stay away from them. Using them in the initial stages of learning is just going to make you dumb.
