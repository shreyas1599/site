  <div>
    I had been using Goodreads regularly for a couple of years. I even
    participated in the{" "}
    <span className="text-blue-500">
      [Annual Challenge](https://goodreads.com)
    </span>
    of setting a target of a number of books to read by the end of the year. I
    also tried to keep up with religiously writing reviews for books that I
    read. More so, for solidifying my own understanding of my own tastes more
    than anything else.
    <br />
    It was a good undertaking but I'd always end up lazing around before writing
    a review and the end result was always a half-assed attempt. Plus, after
    writing about half the reviews that I wrote, it was glaringly obvious that I
    was mostly reading crime fiction or a subtle variant of it.
    <br />
    Anyway, in 2023 I read about 90 books and in 2022 it was around 50. In 2022,
    I started off without any intention of reaching a target. But as I inched
    closer to 50, I wanted to hit the glory century mark. There's no prize for
    winning this contest but it was a challenge to myself (
    <i>
      of course the people who I follow on Goodreads who read hundreds of books
      a year added to it!
    </i>
    )
    <br />
    The good part about it was that the target number only played in my head
    until I picked up a book or between reads but never when I was reading any
    of them. Reading also helped alleviate some of the stress from other facets
    of my life. In essence, I was using it as a coping mechanism. It was good
    while it lasted. I knew I'd eventually get bored of it. And bored did I get
    by the end of it.
    <br />
    Eventually, at the end of the year I took a break and changed platforms. I'm
    writing this to justify to myself that switching platforms was a good
    decision. Perhaps as an excuse to get back into writing reviews, but on my
    personal website (just for vanity!) and for 'T+10 years me' to have a laugh
    or reminisce about the good ol' days.

  <h2 className="text-xl font-bold pb-2">Why did I want to switch</h2>
  <div>
    By far, the biggest reason I wanted to switch to an alternative was{" "}
    <span className="font-kodeMono bg-black p-1 text-xs px-2 rounded-lg">
      Dark Mode
    </span>
    . I think that alone should be enough to conclude this article? If I used
    Goodreads exclusively on my computer it wouldn't be much of a problem and
    Chrome extensions could solve this. Unfortunately, I'm beholden to the
    tinier version of the rectangular piece of metal.
    <br />
    On the phone, at least on iOS, the app is horrible. The app probably hasn't
    had a decent overhaul in at least a decade (judging just by the looks of
    it?). A couple of other problems on the mobile which I can recall (it's been
    a few months since I used Goodreads but I can reasonably assume that nothing
    would've improved because it probably doesn't make Amazon a profit):
    <br />
    <ol className="list-disc flex flex-col gap-2">
      <li>
        <span className="font-semibold italic">No saved drafts:</span> Often
        times after typing out a large paragraph for a review, I'd just copy it
        onto my phone's clipboard, because the app was not reliable when I hit
        submit. Many times, it would fail to submit, close the submit modal and
        my review would disppear. I'd have to type it all over again.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span className="font-semibold italic">
          No formatting options for the review editor:
        </span>
        If you want to add bold or italics, you have to hand write the HTML
        tags. There's no formatting toolbar. Yeah in 2024 there's no formatting
        toolbar, for a review site!
      </li>
      <li>
        <span className="font-semibold italic">Yester year UI:</span> The UI saw
        no reasonable improvements over the years and well, I like seeing a new
        or refreshed skin on the apps I use once in a while. All the buttons
        felt a bit too ancient sort of like an enterprise application. It
        doesn't exactly align with business goals but it isn't my company and I
        can have expectations as an end user :)
      </li>
      <li>
        <span className="font-semibold italic">Bugs:</span>
        For some reason, I could never really accept friend requests within the
        app. It'd always fail and I'd end up on Safari trying to Click Accept.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span className="font-semibold italic">
          Unsatisfactory Recommendations:
        </span>
        I never did read any of the recommendations. I did not find many of them
        enticing. I usually used the user curated lists' feature and what other
        people I follow read to find my next read.

  <h2 className="text-xl font-bold pb-2">What about Storygraph</h2>
  <div>
    I had been reading about{" "}
    <a
      href="https://app.thestorygraph.com"
      target="_blank"
      class="text-blue-500"
    >
      StoryGraph
    </a>{" "}
    as a viable alternative for a while on Reddit and finally decided to try it
    out. They have a way to export all your reviews and reads on Goodreads in
    case you're worried about switching platforms and losing all of your data.
    So far, there's only one thing I don't like about it. In Goodreads, the
    whole feed of reading other people's reviews and finding books to read was a
    whole lot better. Storygraph does have a similar feature but it doesn't feel
    as good. I will give Goodreads that. But that isn't enough motivation to
    stop using it. Of note, I like the following of Storygraph and continue to
    use it:
    <br />
    <ol className="list-disc flex flex-col gap-2">
      <li>
        <span className="font-semibold italic">Recommendations:</span>
        The recommendations are really good. It asks you to fill in a couple of
        basic information and generates a bunch of recommendations (which you
        can continually refresh). Sort of like the Spotify Recommendation
        Refresh button in a playlist.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span className="font-semibold italic">Dark Mode:</span>
        Nothing else to say here
      </li>
      <li>
        <span className="font-semibold italic">Fancy analytics:</span>I don't
        particularly use this but reading stats are nice to look at once in a
        while.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span className="font-semibold italic">A proper review editor:</span>
        Finally, a review editor where I don't have to add html formatting tags
        myself!
      </li>
    </ol>

  <h2 className="text-xl font-bold pb-2">Conclusion</h2>
  <div>
    For my use case, where I need a review site where I can start a Reading
    challege, record the books I read and reviews associated with them with a
    Dark Mode screen, StoryGraph does the job for me. I don't use many of the
    community features of GoodReads. But if you're into that, then maybe you
    might find it a tad hard. While StoryGraph does have all those community
    features built in (<i>and some in progress</i>), it doesn't have the same
    population of users to make it worthwhile, but it's growing and will get
    there.
