	For the past couple of days I've been watching the Olympics and there's one particular incident where an athelete was the target of horrible abuse and vicious attacks merely because people on social media (special mention to J.K Rowling and Logan Paul) don't have brain cells. The fall of J.K Rowling from a great writer to a 2-cent nincompoop transphobe masquerading as "saviour for women" has been disappointing to say the least. No more business from me to her or <i>Robert Galbraith</i>. And Logan Paul, why did I even bring up that crypto fraud's name...

	Anyway, as you can probably guess (<i>unless you've been living under a rock</i>), I'm talking about <i>Imane Khelif</i>. It was heartbreaking to read the abuse meted out to her. <i>Even if</i> she was trans (which she isn't), that's no way to treat someone with all the struggles they had to go through, paying their own way to where they are right now at the Olympics, going through all the remaining [hurdles](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/sport/explainer-who-algerian-boxer-imane-khelif-4524831) only for keyboard warriors and two-second fame seekers to abuse her online and offline. People could've just googled and within 2 mins found out that she was a victim of a smear campaign. But no, everyone has to jump the gun and get their 2 seconds brain rot fame. I hope all those who posted against Khelif get at least 1 week of sleepless nights (<i>Is that a fair ask, Universe?</i>).

	Just take a look at the below excerpt I picked from the article and tell me reading it doesn't evoke anything in you. And then go back and read all the abuse meted out to her and read the below again.

    			Training was not easy. With her father working as a welder in the desert, she would sell scrap metal and her mother's couscous to raise the bus fare for the 10 km (6 mile) ride to the nearest gym.
    			"It‚Äôs being able to overcome the obstacles in my life," she is quoted as saying in her UNICEF biography when asked what makes her most proud.

	For those living under a rock, Imane Khelif thrashed Angela Carini in a boxing match at the Olympics, and Angela Carini chickened out and withdrew herself from the contest. And being the sole loser that she is, she drew attention to the  <i>non-feminine</i> characteristics of Imane Khelif and tried to portray herself as being scared to fight a "man". Talk about being a sore loser. And then, and then, the entire world jumped the gun to "save" the "lone white woman" fighting a "battle of the ages". Lol. All the "influencers" who shut their mouths for months together about Palestine suddenly found their voices. üëèüëèüëè.
	<br />
	(<i><b>Aside</b>: If you've somehow landed on this page,  please donate to Palestine. <span className="text-blue-500">[UNRWA](https://www.unrwa.org/)</span> is a good place to start and you can trust them because genocide Israel has launched a smear campaign against them effectively cutting off more than 80% of their funding. Yes, I have put my money where my mouth is with this.</i>)
	<br />
	Anyway, back to the story. Khelif's next opponent in the quarter finals was a Hungarian boxer sharing brainless posts about Khelif not being a "woman" on her instagram. She even received a final warning from the IOC and deleted all her stories. She doesn't deserve to be named here.
	<br />
	The brain rot lost 5-0 to Khelif lmao. 'Twas most satisfying news I've googled in a while. Praying that Khelif wins the Gold this year and gets backed to sue the bastards who tarnished her image, to oblivion. Fat chance of that happening though. The universe isn't fair. But her winning a Gold will be one for the ages and for all those of us rooting for her! And I also pray for the brain rot Angela Carini to lose all her future matches. After doing all the damage, she had the effing gall to come out and say <span className="text-blue-500">["Oops my bad"](https://www.businesstoday.in/sports/olympics/story/im-sorry-for-italian-boxer-angela-carini-wants-to-apologise-to-algerian-opponent-after-controversial-olympic-bout-439988-2024-08-03)</span>.

		I have more thoughts about the Olympics and why is a 1.4B people country (India) barely winning anything. But that's fodder for another post.
